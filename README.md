# scholarC
I believe that everyone deserves to be able to go to college and afford its tuition. The problem is that many people offer students scholarships but students do not know where to begin looking for them. They could search the internet, but this process would be too long and overwhelming. I created an application that allows students to enter basic information about themselves and find scholarships that best fits them. ScholarC uses Bing to find the Links that best fit, crawls those web pages, and return the results(around 50) to the students all around 5 seconds.
